    "    This is a report on predicting the probability of a traffic accident based on various factors particularly in the City of Seattle, Washington. The predictive analysis can be used by the government and its citizens for mitigating or avoiding such accidents, and to improve circumstances where possible. Lowering the impact or avoiding traffic accidents will decrease the amount of property damage and human injury, and can also reduce traffic jams within the community."
